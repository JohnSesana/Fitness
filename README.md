# Fitness & Nutrition Tracker Dashboard

## Overview
This is a Power BI dashboard designed to help me track and improve my fitness and nutrition habits. By visualizing my workout and diet data, I can make better decisions and stay accountable.

## Data Sources
- **Hevy App**: I log my workouts in the Hevy app while at the gym. Later, I export the CSV data and import it into Power BI.
- **Macrofactor App**: I use Macrofactor to track my nutrition, aiming to log my meals every day. This data is also exported and added to Power BI for analysis.

## Features
- Workout tracking (volume, exercises, trends)
- Nutrition tracking (macros, calories, consistency)
- Progress visualization over time
- KPIs for Powerlifting and dynamic weekly goal setting

## Example (some data might be missing) :

## How to Use
1. Export workout data from Hevy (CSV format) and import it into Power BI.
2. Export nutrition data from Macrofactor and import it into Power BI.
   - I used the options:
     - Calories & Macros
     - Micronutrients
     - Scale Weight (I added the fat percentage manually in some dates)
     - Expenditure (I don't think the app did well on this one so I calculated myself on PBI)   
4. Refresh the dashboard to update insights and track progress.

## Future Improvements
- Extra Page on Nutrition (Micronutrients & Weight Analysis)
- Extra Page on Exercise Progression
